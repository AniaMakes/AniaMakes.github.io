	<h2>About this website</h2>
	<p>
		Every so often I write a larger piece about some tech thing. Not often, but enough to have a website people can come to visit. For years, I've been overwhelmed by the idea of trying to use one of the static site generators (eleventy, jekyll, hugo), but those appear to be aimed at <em>blogs</em> rather than long form pieces with style that differs from piece to piece. So, this website is hand-coded HTML. Sometimes going back to basics is the way to go.

	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>At the time of writing it's December 2021. The plague is still going strong. I miss being around people, I miss hanging out with my friends. Work keeps me busy and I'm grateful for my kind and considerate colleagues who have been helping me to grow professionally for the past two years. As many others, I try to keep afloat: jogging and cycling when I have the energy to do so; playing Animal Crossing New Horizons; doing arts and crafts; growing fruit and vegetables in our garden, and plants on our windowsills... Trying not to get overwhelmed by all the things going on in the world.</p>

			<h3>They Left, Now What?</h3>
			<p><em>Conference talk delivered 3rd of April 2019 at <a href="https://2019.frontendne.co.uk/schedule.html#ania-bebb">FrontEndNE</a> - no video available</em></p>
			<p>Alongside Agile and Extreme Programming, flat organisational structures are becoming more and more popular. They encourage transparency, as well as knowledge sharing. Nevertheless, often tasks and processes are owned by one person, and are not documented well (or at all). This talk will explore what organisations can do to avoid the essential knowledge being lost as staff moves on. The talk will also tackle this subject from a different angle; one that is relevant to most human beings.</p>

				Modules 101: how and why of exporting and importing in JavaScript
			</a></h3>
			<p><em>Article written in the Autumn of 2018</em></p>
			<p>I always struggle to remember how to export and import functions in JavaScript - the methods differ depending if your code gets transpiled, for example. I struggled to find a at-a-glance comparison, so I made my own (see the <a href="./modules-101.html#tldr">TL;DR</a>) - and compiled all sort of historical and background information to go with it. </p>

			<h3><a href="./testing-201.html">Testing 201: What to test</a></h3>
			<p><em>Opinion piece written in June 2020</em></p>
			<p>Based on a series of interviews I conducted with my coworkers during Spring of 2020, this opinion piece combines the information obtained into a rough guide as to what should one test, and what approaches to take.</p>
